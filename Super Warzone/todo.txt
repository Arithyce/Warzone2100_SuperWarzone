-
// artillery aa have the same range as their anti-surface counterparts, and the same reload time, //
// however, they are direct fire and only use the artillery round modifier and specific subclass, //
// as such, they will need radar to increase their range, //
// note that for direct fire weapons, any source of radar will increase their range, such as your army, //
// unlike indirect, which needs to be assigned to a dedicated sensor. //
