// this mod includes a huge rebalance to all weapons, mostly via modifiers. //
// anti-personnel has been rebalanced to do more overall damage to units, less overall damage to structures, and now does more damage the softer the unit/structure is. //
// anti-tank has been rebalanced to do more overall damage to units, more damage the harder the unit is, and less overall damage to structures, more damage the softer the structure is. //
// all-rounder has been rebalanced to do more overall damage to units, less overall damage to structures, and now does more damage the softer the target is. //
// all-rounder now does median damage between anti-personnel and anti-tank, with a preference of damaging softer targets, because of this, the cannon branch is still OP, and this really cannot be addressed. //
// the rest have "minor" tweaks, ask me about it if curious, or compare the files yourself. //
